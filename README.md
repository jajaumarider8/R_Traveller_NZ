# R - Analysis of overseas and residence arrivals in NZ
This is a personal project to process and visualise data in R. The source data is obtained from the International Travel release on the Stats NZ's website https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/international-travel-november-2019. 

The analysis of monthly and annual trend is done for both overseas visitors and residence travellers in NZ. Sample images generated in this script are shown below.
